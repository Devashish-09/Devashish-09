Hello! Amigos 
Myself Devashish Gupta
I am a diligent and driven B.Tech student majoring in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at NIT Raipur.
With a strong passion for data analytics and technology, I am eager to combine my engineering background with my interest in leveraging data to drive innovative solutions.
I am actively seeking internship opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to projects that align with my ambitions.

Beyond academics, I'm also an avid cinephile and believe in the power of storytelling to connect and inspire.
Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate for success!
